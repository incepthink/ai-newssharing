/**
 * The shapes the DGIPR layer is built from.
 *
 * A **release** is not an article, and this file exists because bending it into
 * `NewsArticle` would have been wrong in five places at once. `types/news.ts`
 * derives its fields from what the scraped corpus actually holds — a URL that
 * was swept, a section page it sat on, a position in that page's markup, a
 * `dateModified` that moves when a newsroom rewrites a running story. A press
 * release issued by the Directorate General of Information and Public Relations
 * has none of those. It is issued once, by a department, on a day, about a
 * subject the department chose, and it is never promoted, never rewritten and
 * never in competition for a front page.
 *
 * So the two live side by side and never in the same table. See
 * `src/lib/dgipr/read.ts` for the rest of that argument, and
 * `scripts/dgipr/pull.mjs` for where these rows come from.

 * release is the opposite kind of object. It is a government department's own
 * public-information output, issued to be carried, already republished in full
 * on mahasamvad.in and in every paper that runs it. Withholding it would be
 * caution copied from a case it does not apply to.
 *
 * Everything stays in Marathi. The releases are issued in Marathi, the map is
 * Marathi-first, and a translation on this surface would be this app putting
