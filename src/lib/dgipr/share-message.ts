 * The plain-text Marathi message a reader forwards to WhatsApp, the OS share
 * sheet, or the clipboard.
 *
 * Ported from the sibling `maharashtra-in-a-glance`, whose version of this file
 * carries the same two WhatsApp ceilings and the same rule about never quietly
 * shortening what it sends. The template is this product's own, and it differs
 * in one way worth stating up front: **that repo has a `summary` field and this
 * one does not.** `summaryMr` here is the release in full — the four Pune
 * notices run 2,872 to 7,134 characters — so a message built the sibling's way
 * would blow the 4,000-character ceiling on a *single* selection. What goes in
 * instead is the release's own opening paragraph; see `leadParagraph`.
 *
 * Rules that must not be broken:
 *  - the lead is reproduced verbatim, never trimmed, summarised or rewritten;
 *  - no emoji or emoji-like symbols, rule separators only;
 *  - the PDF and DOCX links are absolute, so the message is worth something
 *    outside the site it was assembled on.

 * argument for the excerpt on a card.
 *
 * The card takes paragraph `[0]` and that is good enough behind a four-line
 * clamp. It is not good enough here, because a message is the whole of what the
 * recipient gets: `ms-213391` opens with a 58-character standfirst and its real
 * lead is the second paragraph, and 22 of the 141 rows have a first paragraph
 * under 120 characters.
 *
 * The test is the dateline rather than a length threshold, because length is a
 * proxy and the dateline is the actual thing being looked for — a standfirst has
 * no `पुणे, दि. ३० :` on it and a lead always does. Over the whole corpus: 103
 * rows take paragraph 1, 19 take a later one (skipping a standfirst, which is
 * the case this exists for), and 19 carry no dateline at all and fall back to
 * `[0]`. The leads that come out run to a median of 389 characters and a
